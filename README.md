Drug Authentication & Anti-Counterfeiting System (Blockchain)
A blockchain-based system to verify the authenticity of pharmaceutical drugs and prevent counterfeiting across the supply chain.
This project uses smart contracts to register manufacturers, track drug batches, and allow verification by distributors, pharmacies, and consumers.

Problem Statement
Counterfeit medicines are a serious global issue that cause health risks, financial losses, and loss of trust in healthcare systems.
Traditional supply chains lack transparency and are prone to tampering and data manipulation.

This project solves this by using blockchain to provide:

Immutable records
Transparent tracking of drug batches
Public verification of authenticity
Features
Manufacturer registration
Drug batch creation and tracking
Ownership transfer across supply chain
Public verification of drug authenticity
Immutable on-chain audit trail
Role-based access control (manufacturer, distributor, pharmacy, consumer)
Tech Stack
Solidity – Smart contracts
Foundry – Development, testing, deployment
Ethereum-compatible network – Local Anvil / Testnet / Polygon (optional)
Node.js – (Optional backend integration)
Frontend – (Optional UI integration)
Project Structure
drug-authentication-blockchain/ ├── src/ # Solidity smart contracts ├── script/ # Deployment scripts ├── test/ # Smart contract test cases ├── lib/ # Foundry dependencies ├── .gitignore └── README.md

Setup & Run (Local)
forge install forge build forge test

Use Cases
-> Pharmaceutical manufacturers -> Distributors & logistics partners -> Pharmacies -> Consumers verifying drug authenticity -> Regulators and auditors

Future Improvements
-> QR code-based verification -> Frontend dashboard for tracking -> Integration with Polygon testnet/mainnet -> IPFS storage for drug metadata -> Role management UI
